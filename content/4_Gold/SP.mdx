Nearly all Gold shortest path problems involve Dijkstra. However, it's a good idea to learn Bellman-Ford and Floyd-Warshall first since they're simpler.

<Optional title="Incorrect Floyd-Warshall">

[Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.01210.pdf)

> A common mistake in implementing the Floyd–Warshall algorithm is to misorder the triply nested loops (The correct order is `KIJ`). The incorrect `IJK` and `IKJ` algorithms do not give correct solutions for some instance. However, we can prove that if these are repeated three times, we obtain the correct solutions.
>
> It would be emphasized that these fixes (repeating incorrect algorithms three times) have the same time complexity as the correct Floyd–Warshall algorithm up to constant factors. Therefore, our results suggest that, if one is confused by the order of the triply nested loops, one can repeat the procedure three times just to be safe.

## Dijkstra

<FocusProblem problem={problems.sample[0]} />

[Dijkstra's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) finds the single source shortest path on a graph **without** negative weights.
We begin from the source source, and set the distances to all nodes except the starting one to infinite. 
We maintain one set of nodes marked as *open* and the other set marked as *closed*. Initially, all nodes are in the open set except the source node.
When a node enters the closed set, its distance to the source is fixed and can be proven to be the minimal distance. The algorithm will also process all edges starting at that node. 
If an edge starting from that node $u$ can reduce the distance to another node $v$, or 
$$ 
	d[u]+w[u][v]<d[v], 
$$
where $w[u][v]$ is the weight of the edge connecting u and v, node v will also enter the closed set. At each iteration, the algorithm would process one unprocessed node $v$ that has entered the closed set which has the lowest distance to a processed node, or a node with $min(w[u][v])$.

Furthermore, we can use a [priority queue](https://usaco.guide/silver/intro-ordered/#priority-queues) that sorts nodes based on their distances to efficiently find the unprocessed minimum distance node. This allows us to determine the next node to process in $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$ time, where $N$ is the number of nodes.
The time complexity of the resulting algorithm is $\mathcal{O}((M+N) \log N)$, where M is the number of edge. Since we can assume that for most cases $M > N$, the final time complexity is $\mathcal{O}(M \log N)$.

### $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$

The USACO training pages present a $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ implementation, although this is rarely used nowadays.

Recall from the second prerequisite module that we can use `greater<>` to make the top element of a priority queue the least instead of the greatest. Alternatively, you can negate distances before placing them into the priority queue, but that's more confusing.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

using ll = long long;
#define pb push_back

vector<pair<int, int>> graph[100000];
// Adjacency list of (neighbour, edge weight)
ll dist[100000];
int N;

void dijkstra(int src) { // Source and destination
	for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) dist[i] = LLONG_MAX;
	// Set all distances to infinity

	using T = pair<ll,int>; priority_queue<T,vector<T>,greater<T>> pq;
	dist[src] = 0; // The shortest path from a node to itself is 0
	pq.push({0, src});

	while (pq.size()) {
		ll cdist; int node; tie(cdist, node) = pq.top(); pq.pop();
		if (cdist != dist[node]) continue;
		for (pair<int, int> i : graph[node]) {
			// If we can reach a neighbouring node faster,
			// we update its minimum distance
			if (cdist+i.second < dist[i.first]) {
				pq.push({dist[i.first] = cdist+i.second, i.first});
			}
		}
	}
}

int main() {
	int M; cin >> N >> M;
	for (int i = 0; i < M; ++i) {
		int a,b,c; cin >> a >> b >> c;
		graph[a-1].pb({b-1,c});
	}
	dijkstra(0);
	for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) cout << dist[i] << " ";
}
```

<Warning>

It's important to include `continue`. This ensures that when all edge weights are non-negative, we will never go through the adjacency list of any vertex more than once. Removing it will cause TLE on the last test case of the above problem! 

The last test case contains 100000 destinations and 149997 flights. City 1 has flights to cities 2 through 50000. Cities 2 through 50000 have flights to city 50001. City 50001 has flights to cities 50002 through 100000. Without the `continue`, after the program pops cities 1 through 50000 off the queue, the priority queue will contain 49999 routes that end at city 50001. Every one of the 49999 times city 50001 is popped off the queue and processed, we must iterate over all of its outgoing flights (to cities 50002 through 100000). This results in a runtime of $\Theta(N^2\log N)$, which will TLE. 

On the other hand, if we did include the `continue`, the program will never iterate through the adjacency list of city 50001 after processing it for the first time.

        for v, w in edges[u]:

                dist[v] = dist[u]+w  # Update the distance and

for i in range(m):

Unfortunately, Python is too slow to pass all the test cases, but the implementation is correct.

<Optional title="Faster Dijkstra">

Can be done in $\mathcal{O}(M+N\log N)$ with [Fibonacci heap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_heap). In practice though, this is rarely faster, since the Fibonacci heap has a bad constant factor.
